## Project Description

This project is an interactive Netflix homepage UI clone built with **Flutter** and **Dart**. It fetches movie and series images dynamically using the [TMDb API](https://www.themoviedb.org/), ensuring an authentic and up-to-date visual experience.

### Key Features:

- **Dynamic Image Loading**: All images are retrieved in real-time from TMDb, keeping the app visually updated with the latest content.
- 
- **Interactive UI Elements**: The app includes a responsive bottom navigation bar, horizontally scrollable category rows, and smooth transitions, creating a highly interactive user experience.
- 
- **Dual AppBar with Transparency**: The primary AppBar features a transparent background, allowing for a seamless integration with the content below. A secondary AppBar appears when scrolling up, offering quick access to options like "TV Shows," "Movies," and "Categories."
- 
- **Scrollable Content**: The app supports both vertical scrolling for the main content and horizontal scrolling within each category row, enabling users to explore a wide range of content with ease.

This project showcases the power of Flutter in building responsive and visually rich UIs for mobile, emphasizing real-time API integration and interactive design elements for an immersive user experience.
